# Dijkstra-algorithm-for-a-point-robot
## Part of Coursework - Robot Planning 

Project submission by: Vineet Singh (Directory id: vsingh03)

## Libraries used are: 
>numpy, argparse, timeit, queue, OpenCV, math 

Steps to run the code:
1. Place the python file "dijkstra_code.py" in a Directory
2. Open terminal and navigate to the directory in which the file is placed. 
3. Run the below command in terminal to test any random state:
        
        python3 project1_vineet_singh_code.py --InitState 10 5 --GoalState 240 500

4. Output text files will be generated in the same directory where the code is placed. 

Note: To test any other initial state and goal state, provide the states to --InitState and --GoalState parameter while running the code. Same as in step 3 

Output of the test case will be saved as : 
>dijkstra_simulation.avi
